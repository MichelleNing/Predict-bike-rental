# Predict Daily Bike Sharing Rides

This project is one project for [Udacity Deep Learning NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). 

## Intrduction

Image own one bike sharig company. We need to predict how many bikes the company needs because we need to fill the riders. If less bikes prepared, then it will lose money for pertential riders. If too many, then the bikes only sit around. The purpse is to predict how many bikes it needs daily based on the data in the past year.

One method is with neural networks to make predictions. A notebook is written to load and prepare the data. A .py file includes the details of the neural network which is trained, valid and tested in the notebook.

## Instruction

1. cd into the project directory

2. Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the [anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and [miniconda website](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/).

3. Create a new conda environment:
conda create --name bike-predict python=3

4. Enter your new environment:
- Mac/Linux: `>> source activate bike-predict`
- Windows: `>> activate bike-predict`

5. Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:
`conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook`

6. Run the following to open up the notebook server:
`jupyter notebook`
